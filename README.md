2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
                1. The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s)
Prior to this, programming was done using machine code or assembly language, which was extremely time-consuming and error-prone. The creation of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, and later C, made it much easier to write, understand, and maintain code. These languages introduced abstraction, allowing programmers to focus more on solving problems rather than dealing with hardware specifics.

                **2. The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1968)**
In the late 1960s, the "software crisis" emerged as projects became more complex and failed to meet deadlines, budgets, and quality standards. At the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference, the term "software engineering" was introduced to address these issues by applying engineering principles to software development. This milestone emphasized the need for structured approaches, formal methodologies, and better project management practices.

                    3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The publication of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 marked a significant shift in software development practices. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promoted iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability. This approach contrasted with traditional, rigid methodologies like Waterfall, and allowed for more flexible and responsive development processes, better suited to the rapidly changing technology landscape.


3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: This initial phase involves gathering requirements, understanding the project scope, and creating a plan. Key activities include feasibility studies, resource allocation, and risk assessment.

Analysis: In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered and analyzed. This includes defining the functional and non-functional requirements, creating use cases, and identifying potential challenges.

Design: The design phase involves creating the architecture and design for the software. This includes designing the system architecture, user interfaces, databases, and data flow diagrams.

Implementation (Coding): This is where the actual coding happens. Developers write the code based on the design specifications. This phase also includes unit testing to ensure the code functions correctly.

Testing: The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects. This includes various types of testing such as integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

Deployment: Once the software passes all tests, it is deployed to a live environment. This phase includes installation, configuration, and user training.

Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves monitoring the software for issues, applying updates, and making necessary enhancements.


4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
              Waterfall Methodology
